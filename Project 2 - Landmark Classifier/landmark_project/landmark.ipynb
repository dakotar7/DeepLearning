    "\n",
    "Photo sharing and photo storage services like to have location data for each photo that is uploaded. With the location data, these services can build advanced features, such as automatic suggestion of relevant tags or automatic photo organization, which help provide a compelling user experience. Although a photo's location can often be obtained by looking at the photo's metadata, many photos uploaded to these services will not have location metadata available. This can happen when, for example, the camera capturing the picture does not have GPS or if a photo's metadata is scrubbed due to privacy concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "If no location metadata for an image is available, one way to infer the location is to detect and classify a discernible landmark in the image. Given the large number of landmarks across the world and the immense volume of images that are uploaded to photo sharing services, using human judgement to classify these landmarks would not be feasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will take the first steps towards addressing this problem by building models to automatically predict the location of the image based on any landmarks depicted in the image. At the end of this project, your code will accept any user-supplied image as input and suggest the top k most relevant landmarks from 50 possible landmarks from across the world. The image below displays a potential sample output of your finished project.\n",

    "\n",

    "Third, while transfer learning worked very well to bring us to 75% accuracy, there appears to be diminishing returns. This could be solved by having larger training sets, but it could definitely be improved by retraining more of the model than just the classifier portion. Or perhaps adding more layers to the classifier portion.\n",
