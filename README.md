# DeepLearning
Repo for the Projects for and related to the Udacity Deep Learning course.

I am in the process of converting the Notebook files where Udacity had us write the projects into Python files that could be distributed and utilized. I had waited to do this until the completion of the Certificate Course, which occured on June 24th, 2022. 

### Project 1 - *Complete*

### Project 2 - *Complete*

### Project 3 - *In Progress as of 6/29/22*

### Project 4 - *Pending*

### Project 5 - *Pending*

Following the successful conversion from a Jupyter Notebook to Python script files, I will commence implementation of popular and important Deep Learning research papers (modified as needed to fit my hardware constraints) as personal projects to demonstrate my knowledge and abilities in this space.
